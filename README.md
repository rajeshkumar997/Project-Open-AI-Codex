<br>
Codex is an open source chatbot framework built on top of OpenAI's GPT-3 language model. It allows developers to quickly and easily create conversational AI applications that can understand natural language and respond in a meaningful way.
<br>
Codex is designed to be easy to use and extend, allowing developers to quickly create custom chatbot applications with minimal effort. It provides a simple API for creating custom chatbot applications, as well as a set of pre-built components for common tasks such as natural language understanding, dialog management, and response generation.
<br>
Codex also provides an interactive web-based development environment for quickly prototyping and testing your chatbot applications. This environment allows you to interact with your bot in real time, giving you immediate feedback on how it responds to user input.
<br>
We hope that ChatGPT will make it easier for developers to create powerful conversational AI applications that can understand natural language and respond in a meaningful way. We look forward to seeing what you build!
